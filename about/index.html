I'm the guy who saved up my allowance at age 10 to buy my very first computerâ€”a Commodore VIC-20. It set me back about 80 bucks, which was a fortune at the time. Since I couldn't afford a disk drive, I had to type in code from the backs of magazines and leave the computer running for weeks if I wanted to keep my work. My parents loved thatâ€¦ the power bill, not so much. But hey, that's how I got hooked on creating things with code.</p><p>From those early days, I always wanted to make video games. So, I dove headfirst into programming, playing and dreaming of ways to turn my love of games into a profession. Eventually, I took the leap and moved to Texas to break into the game development industry. And then, just as I landed my first studio gigâ€¦ it went belly-up. But timing's everything, right? The iPhone had just been released, and the App Store was opening up. I thought, "Why not learn Objective-C and make an app?" My friend and I created a golf app, and it actually took off! It even hit #2 on the App Store, and Apple invited us to be featured. We thought we'd be in one of those classic "there's an app for that" commercials. Well, Apple had other plans, and our competitor ended up in the spotlight. ðŸ˜¢</p><img class="polaroid float-img-right" src="/images/about/rage.jpg" alt="Rage" width="150"/><p>I then got the chance to work at id Software, a dream come true for a kid who idolized the company. I got to work alongside my programming hero, John Carmack. (Yes, it was as surreal as it sounds!)</p><p>Game development is no cakewalk, though. Studios can come and go with the changing tides, and after riding the wave of a few shutdowns, I decided to focus on iOS development full-time. Since then, I've been part of two startups in the Dallas area, building iOS apps, SDKs, and all kinds of techy things for iPhones.</p><p>Now, I'm living in Plano, where I indulge my board game obsession with my wife and friends. If there's a meeple to be moved or dice to be rolled, I'm there!</p><center><img class="polaroid center" src="/images/about/board-games-spirit-island.jpeg" alt="Spirit Island" width="300"/></center></div></div></div><div class="footer pure-u-1"><div class="pure-u-1">Â© 2024 Shawn Casey</div><div class="pure-u-1">Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></div><div class="pure-u-1"><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></div></div></div></body></html>
